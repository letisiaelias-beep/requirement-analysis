# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  
This repository is dedicated to exploring **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Understand how requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated.  
- Provide structured examples and notes on functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Serve as a learning resource for requirement analysis techniques and best practices.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of discovering, clarifying, organizing, and validating what a software system must do and how it should perform. It turns stakeholder needs (users, customers, product owners, business teams, and engineers) into clear, testable, and agreed upon **requirements** that guide design, development, and testing.

### Why it matters in the SDLC
- **Prevents scope creep:** Clear requirements set boundaries for what will (and will not) be built.
- **Reduces rework & cost:** Finding gaps early is far cheaper than fixing them during coding or after release.
- **Aligns the team:** Creates a single source of truth for product, engineering, QA, and stakeholders.
- **Improves quality:** Well defined acceptance criteria make testing objective and thorough.
- **Prioritizes value:** Helps deliver the most important features first.

### Where it fits
Requirement Analysis sits early in the SDLC after idea/feasibility and before design/implementation. Its outputs (user stories, use cases, specifications) feed directly into design and development.
